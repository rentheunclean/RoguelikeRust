RoguelikeRust

Language: Rust

Tutorial: http://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook

I worked through the whole tutorial with minimal changes.  I may pick this back up in the future to add functionality and keep learning more Rust/doing more of this walk through.

I have added some issues and things to try later here:

Libraries: 
  RLTK (rendering and other roguelike stuff)
  Specs (ECS architecture)
